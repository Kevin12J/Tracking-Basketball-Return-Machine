# Tracking-Basketball-Return-Machine
This project is a ramp that mounts underneath a basketball hoop rim and allows for the ball to roll towards the player. 
The ramp tracks the player on the court using a stepper motor which is controlled via an arduino.
The arduino recieves a signal through the serial port from a laptop to know what direction the motor needs to spin.
